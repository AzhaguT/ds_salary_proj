The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI, in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.

Background

The world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health. In order to address these challenges, a robust response based on strengthened health workforce, resilient supply chains and rapid increase in diagnostic capacity is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Program Overview

WJCF, in partnership with its affiliate CHAI, is supporting the COVID-19 response in the areas of testing policy, strengthened data and delivery systems, and development of guidelines. The programme has been supporting the ICMR in scaling up testing, providing data-driven insights to support supply chain management including forecasting and inventory management, and helping build guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for downstream distribution of commodities. Separately, the programme also supports selected states on localized strategies for testing scale up and equitable access, stronger engagement with the private sector, improved treatment readiness, robust awareness campaigns and capacity building initiatives, and analytics-based programme management.

Ericsson is one of the leading providers of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to service providers. We enable the full value of connectivity by creating game-changing technology and services that are easy to use, adopt, and scale, making our customers successful in a fully connected world. Headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, Ericsson is proud of its global presence across 100+ countries and market areas. With a strong focus on innovation, we possess 49 thousand registered patents and a global strength of over 95 thousand competent professionals.

We are a world leader in the rapidly changing environment of communications technology – by providing hardware, software, and services to enable the full value of connectivity.

Exciting Opportunity:

The complexity of emerging 5G networks makes manual management and operations of these networks impossible. AI technologies, including Machine Learning, are increasingly being used to drive intelligent automation and autonomous operation of 5G networks that will drive economic and social transformation. Towards this, we have setup a Global AI Accelerator (GAIA) in the US, Sweden and India, with 300 experts, to fast-track our strategy execution.

We use a combination of Machine Learning and other Artificial Intelligence technologies to drive thought leadership to automate and transform Ericsson offerings and operations, including new and emerging business.

Ericsson is one of the leading providers of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to service providers. We enable the full value of connectivity by creating game-changing technology and services that are easy to use, adopt, and scale, making our customers successful in a fully connected world. Headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, Ericsson is proud of its global presence across 100+ countries and market areas. With a strong focus on innovation, we possess 49 thousand registered patents and a global strength of over 95 thousand competent professionals. We also take pride in supporting networks that cater to a capacity of 40 percent of the world’s mobile traffic, thereby connecting more than 2.5 billion subscribers and counting. We are a world leader in the rapidly changing environment of communications technology – by providing hardware, software, and services to enable the full value of connectivity.

Exciting Opportunity:

The complexity of emerging 5G networks makes manual management and operations of these networks impossible. AI technologies, including AI Reasoning, are increasingly being used to drive intelligent automation and autonomous operation of 5G networks that will drive economic and social transformation. Towards this, we have setup a Global AI Accelerator (GAIA) in the US, Sweden and India, with 300 experts, to fast-track our strategy execution.

We use a combination of Artificial Intelligence technologies to drive thought leadership to automate and transform Ericsson offerings and operations, including new and emerging business. This includes development of models, frameworks and infrastructure where we not only drive AI based product innovation, but also push the AI technology frontiers. We engage in both academic and industry collaborations and drive the digitalization of Ericsson and the industry by developing state of the art solutions that simplify and automate processes in our products and services and build new value through data driven insights.

Machine Learning can produce highly impactful results, however, to build truly autonomous intelligent systems, we also need symbolic knowledge in our systems. Future applications will use a combination of machine learning and AI reasoning to build truly intelligent and intent based autonomous systems. Further, for mission critical telecom systems, safety and trust in the underlying AI algorithms will be paramount. Responsible AI, which is fast emerging as a major research topic, will be key to address issues around bias, safety, security, explainability and trustworthiness of AI algorithms in telecom systems.

Ericsson is now looking for Principal Data Scientists with a strong background in AI Reasoning for our team in Bangalore.

Role Summary:

As a Principal Data Scientist in AI Reasoning, you will build reasoning systems/frameworks for telecom that leverage the vast telecom knowledge base. This will span the range of designing simpler reasoning systems that can operate in near real time in edge/constrained environments to large/complex reasoning systems that can continually analyze the end to end network performance/KPIs to ensure optimal network operation. Such frameworks will incorporate principles of trustworthy AI systems, including safety and explainability. The solutions designed will work at the scale of large telecom systems and be highly reliable. You will interface with business stakeholders to define and formulate the right business problems.

Your knowledge and experience in AI methodologies will be applied to solve challenging real-world problems as part of a highly dynamic and global team. You will work in a highly collaborative environment where you communicate and plan tasks and ideas. You will be working on high impact initiatives with other experts in AI reasoning to drive growth and economic profitability for Ericsson and its customers by accelerating current Ericsson offerings.
